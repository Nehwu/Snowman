# Snowman - see it, or not. Name it, or not. Decorate it, or not. This is the semester project for the TUL ALG1 class.

The program behaves in the following way:

1.  +-------------------------------------+
    |              Hey, buddy!            |
    |   Do you want to see the snowman?   |
    |     Type yes to see him, typing     |
    |   anything else is considered a no. |
    |Press enter after you are done typing|
    +-------------------------------------+
2. The user types "yes"
3. The program displays a new window with three ellipses, with a cornflower blue background. 
4  If the user types "no" or anything that isn't "yes" (even Yes with a capital "Y" is a no-no) the program print out:
5.  +-------------------------------------+
		|                                     |
		|                                     |
		|            Excellent choice!        |
		|    I also don't want to see him :)  |
		|                                     |
		+-------------------------------------+
6.  However, if the user typed "yes" and saw the bare snowman, it asks the user to name him:     
    +-------------------------------------+
    |                                     |
    |  What should be the snowman's name? |
    |     Type the name of the snowman.   |
    |      Don't forget to press enter.   |
    |                                     |
    +-------------------------------------+
7. The program changes the bar title of the opened windows based on the input of the user. Now, instead of "My name is...", 
it displays the user inputted name behind the three dots.
8.  +---------------------------------------------------+
    |                                                   |
    | Do you want to add some decoration to the snowman?|
    |           Type yes for decoration.                |
    |          Don't forget to press enter.             |
    |                                                   |
    +---------------------------------------------------+
9.  The user types "yes" and presses "enter".
10. The snowman reappears with a carrot nose and two coal eyes.
11. Had the instead typed anything else than "yes" the program would display this prompt:
    +---------------------------------------------+
    |                                             |
    |                                             |
    |  You don't want to decorate the snowman :(  |
    |                                             |
    |                                             |
    +---------------------------------------------+
