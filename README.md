Full description of how the program behaves:

1.  Hey, buddy!            
Do you want to see the snowman?   
Type yes to see him, typing     
anything else is considered a no. 
Press enter after you are done typing
 
2. The user types "yes"

3. The program displays a new window with three ellipses, with a cornflower blue background. 

4  If the user types "no" or anything that isn't "yes" (even Yes with a capital "Y" is a no-no) the program print out:
                          
5. Excellent choice!        
I also don't want to see him :)  
		
6.  However, if the user typed "yes" and saw the bare snowman, it asks the user to name him.   

7. The program changes the bar title of the opened window based on the input of the user. Now, instead of "My name is...", 
it displays the user inputted name behind the three dots.

8.  The console asks the user if they want to decorate the snowman.

9.  The user types "yes" and presses "enter".

10. The snowman reappears with a carrot nose and two coal eyes.

11. Had the user instead typed anything other than "yes" the program would display this prompt:

     You don't want to decorate the snowman :(
